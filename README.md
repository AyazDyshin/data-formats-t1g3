# Data formats group project
This is a goup project for Data Formats(NPRG036) course in Charles University.
Role: team leader.
The project consisted of 4 parts, each described below.
In addition to completion of own part of work, the team leader's job was to split tasks and assign those to team members, as well as set dedlines and control completion of those.
## Part 1 - Domain and UML
This part of project was about creating a base for future parts.
I.e coming up with a sutable domain and describing it both textually and using UML Class Diagrams.
## Part 2 - RDF data, RDF Schema, SPARQL, LPG data, Cypher
This part of projected was about working with RDF and LPG data.
It can be split into two main parts:
### RDF
- Create covered model (covered with suitable vocabularies) from existing UML schema.
- Represent data as RDF data (including definition of own RDF classes and properties using RDF Schema).
- Creating queries for the RDF data using SPARQL.
### LPG 
- Create representation schema for the LPG data.
- Represent the data as LPG data.
- Loading the data into Neo4j.
- Creating queries for the LPG data using Cypher.
## Part 3 - XML, XML Schema, XSLT: XML to HTML, XML to RDF, XPath, JSON, JSON Schema, JSON-LD: JSON to RDF, jq
- Create hierarchical model from existing UML schema.
- Create XML Schemas for above hierarchical model.
- Represent data in XML against above created XML Schemas.
- Create XPath queries for above XML data.
- Create XSLT tranformations of above XML data to HTML.
- Create XSLT transformations of above XML data to RDF.
- Create JSON Schema for above hierarchical model.
- Represent data in JSON against above created JSON Schema.
- Create JSON-LD mapping of above JSON data to RDF.
- Create jq queries for above JSON data.
## Part 4 - CSV on the Web.
- Create relational model from exisitng UML schema.
- Create a corresponding CSV on the Web Table group descriptor.
- Represent data in CSV, valid agains above table group descriptors.
- Enhance the CSV on the Web descriptor with virtual columns, and aboutUrl, propertyUrl and valueUrl annotations to create a transformation to RDF.
